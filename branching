Branching is how teams develop and deploy software. But to effectively manage projects with multiple developers and releases, teams need an effective branching strategy for merging code.
A branching strategy, therefore, is the strategy that software development teams adopt when writing, merging and deploying code when using a version control system.

It is essentially a set of rules that developers can follow to stipulate how they interact with a shared codebase.
One big theme is how much work should remain in a branch before getting merged back into main.
